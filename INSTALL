Use `make all` to build OpenSSL 1.0.0 with OpenPACE.

If you choose to patch and build OpenSSL by yourself, make sure to to configure
OpenSSL with PACE support, i.e.:
    ./configure experimental-pace

After building OpenPACE you can use the included pacetest program in the test
directory to see if everything is working correctly.
