HOW TO COMPILE:
---------------

Just use the included Makefile to build version 1.0.0 of OpenSSL with the
OpenPACE patch included.
If you choose to patch and build OpenSSL by yourself, make sure to to configure
OpenSSL with PACE support, i.e.:
    ./configure experimental-pace
After building OpenPACE you can use the included pacetest program in the test
directory to see if everything is working correctly.
