OpenPACE 0.2 05.05.2010

DESCRIPTION:
------------

OpenPACE is an implementation of the Password-Authentication-Connection-
Establishment (PACE) protocol conforming to BSI TR-03110 version 2.03.
OpenPACE enables applications to establish a strong session key using a weak
password independent from the use of a smartcard.
OpenPACE is implemented as a patch for the OpenSSL library (see
http://openssl.org)

NOTE:
-----

OpenPACE does only provide the cryptopgraphic primitives to use the PACE
protocol in you application. If you want to access a german ID (nPA) card using
OpenPACE, you still need code to correctly format, transmit and receive APDUs.
For a program that uses OpenPACE to connect to a nPA check out the
Virtual Smart Card Architecture (http://sourceforge.net/projects/vsmartcard/).
It includes the program pace-tool which can change and resume a PIN and is able
to send arbitrary APDUs through a SM channel established with PACE.

FEEDBACK:
---------

If you encounter any problems using OpenPACE or have any ideas or even code
to contribute, don't hesitate to contacte the authors via mail.
