OpenPACE 0.2 05.05.2010

DESCRIPTION:
------------

OpenPACE is an implementation of the Password-Authentication-Connection-
Establishment (PACE) protocol conforming to BSI TR-03110 version 2.03.
OpenPACE enables applications to establish a strong session key using a weak
password independent from the use of a smartcard.
OpenPACE is implemented as an addition for the OpenSSL library (see
http://openssl.org)

HOW TO COMPILE:
---------------

Just use the included Makefile to build version 1.0.0 of OpenSSL with the
OpenPACE patch included.
If you choose to patch and build OpenSSL by yourself, make sure to to configure
OpenSSL with PACE support, i.e.:
    ./configure experimental-pace
After building OpenPACE you can use the included pacetest program in the test
directory to see if everything is working correctly.

NOTE:
-----

OpenPACE does only provide the cryptopgraphic primitives to use the PACE
protocol in you application. If you want to access a german ID (nPA) card using
OpenPACE, you still need code to correctly format, transmit and receive APDUs.
For a program that uses OpenPACE to connect to a nPA see
http://sourceforge.net/projects/vsmartcard/
