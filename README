OpenPACE is a cryptographic library which provides support for the main
protocols of the Extended Access Control (EAC) version 2 specified in `BSI
TR-03110
<https://www.bsi.bund.de/ContentBSI/Publikationen/TechnischeRichtlinien/tr03110/index_htm.html>`_
and is used to establish a Secure Channel with the new German identity card.
OpenPACE comprises support for the following protocols:

- The Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE) protocol. This
  protocol is used to establish a secure channel between two parties that only
  share a weak secret.  In the context of the new German identity card PACE is
  used to secure the wireless communication between the ID card and the point
  of PIN entry (either the RFID reader or the PC).
- The Terminal Authentication (TA) protocol. This protocol is used to
  authenticate the terminal which wants to use the identity card and to
  establish the access rights of this terminal.
- The Chip Authentication (CA) protocol. This protocol is used to authenticate
  the identity card based and to establish a secure end-to-end channel between
  the card and the terminal.

Furthermore, OpenPACE also supports Card Verifiable Certificates (CV
Certificates) as specified in BSI TR-03110.

Please note that OpenPACE only implements the cryptographic protocols of the
EAC. If you actually want to exchange data with an RFID card, you need to take
care of formatting and sending the data in the form of APDUs. If this is what
you're trying to do, you should have a look at the ``npa-tool`` of the `nPA
Smart Card Library <http://vsmartcard.sourceforge.net/npa/README.html>`_.
