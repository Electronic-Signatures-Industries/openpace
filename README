OpenPACE is an implementation of the protocols used in the Extended Access
Control version 2, specified in BSI TR-03110 version 2.05.  OpenPACE implements
the Password Authenticated Connection Establishment Protocol (PACE), as well as
Terminal Authentication (TA) and Chip Authentication (CA). It also contains
support for Card Verifiable Certificates (CV certificates).

PACE itself (and thus OpenPACE) enables applications to establish a strong
session key using a weak password independent from the use of a smart card.
OpenPACE is implemented as a patch for the OpenSSL library (see
http://openssl.org)


NOTE
----

OpenPACE does only provide the cryptopgraphic primitives to use the PACE
protocol, Terminal Authentication and Chip Authentication in your application.
If you want to access the new German ID card (nPA) using OpenPACE, you still
need code to correctly format, transmit and receive APDUs.  For a program that
uses OpenPACE to connect to a nPA check out the Virtual Smart Card Architecture
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/vsmartcard/).  It includes the program
npa-tool which can change and resume a PIN and is able to send arbitrary APDUs
through a SM channel established with PACE.
