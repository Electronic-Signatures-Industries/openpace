Including OpenPACE in other programming languages
#################################################

OpenPACE uses `SWIG`_ to offer bindings in other programming
languages. The bindings are easily portable to lots of different languages. Currently OpenPACE encompasses easy-to-use wrappers for Python and
Java.

.. versionadded:: 0.8
    The SWIG bindings from `pyPACE`_ have been integrated into OpenPACE.

.. seealso::

    See the `OpenPACE API documentation <_static/doxygen/modules.html>`_
    for the native C/C++ interface

************************
Using OpenPACE in Python
************************

In order to run programs that use the Python bindings you have to set up the :envvar:`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
environment variable to point to the OpenPACE library. One way to do this is::

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/libeac

You also might need to setup the :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` environment variable if you did not
install the bindings in a location already included in the :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`.

In order to test your installation you can use the ``test.py`` script included in
OpenPACE. Simply run the following command::

    python src/python/test.py

Please note that currently the Python bindings do not work with Python 3.

You may have a look at the `Emulator for the German Identity Card`_ to see the
Python bindings in action. Unfortunately, OpenPACE's Python bindings are
currently :ref:`poorly documented <python_api>`.


**********************
Using OpenPACE in Java
**********************

The OpenPACE Java bindings are experimental and currently disabled by default.
You need to configure OpenPACE with :option:`--enable-java` to build and install
them. You may set the :envvar:`JAVAC` environment variable to your preferred Java
compiler.
