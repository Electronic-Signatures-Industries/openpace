Including OpenPACE in other programming languages
#################################################

OpenPACE uses `SWIG`_ to offer bindings in other programming languages. The
bindings are easily portable to lots of different languages.  Currently, native
language bindings need to be explicitly turned on with ``./configure
--enable-...``

If you have chosen to install OpenPACE in a non-standard location you have to
set up the :envvar:`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable correctly. One way to
do this is::

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/libeac

.. versionadded:: 0.8
    The SWIG bindings from `pyPACE`_ have been integrated into OpenPACE.

.. versionadded:: 0.9
    - Added Ruby bindings.
    - Added Go bindings.

.. seealso::

    See the `OpenPACE API documentation <_static/doxygen/modules.html>`_
    for the native C/C++ interface

************************
Using OpenPACE in Python
************************

In case of a non-standard installation of OpenPACE you might -- in addition to
:envvar:`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` -- also need to setup the :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`
environment variable.

Here is a sample skript that shows how OpenPACE is accessed from Python:

.. literalinclude:: ../bindings/python/example.py
    :language: python

You may have a look at the `Emulator for the German Identity Card`_ to see the
Python bindings in action. Unfortunately, OpenPACE's Python bindings are
currently :ref:`poorly documented <python_api>`.


**********************
Using OpenPACE in Ruby
**********************

Here is a sample skript that shows how OpenPACE is accessed from Ruby:

.. literalinclude:: ../bindings/ruby/example.rb
    :language: ruby


********************
Using OpenPACE in Go
********************

Here is a sample skript that shows how OpenPACE is accessed from Ruby:

.. literalinclude:: ../bindings/go/example.go
    :language: go


**********************
Using OpenPACE in Java
**********************

The OpenPACE Java bindings are experimental and currently disabled by default.
You need to configure OpenPACE with :option:`--enable-java` to build and install
them. You may set the :envvar:`JAVAC` environment variable to your preferred Java
compiler.
